From his early roles as young punks and ne'er do-wells in movies like Quadrophenia, Scum and Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains through his unforgettable performances in Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, Winstone cornered the market in British hard men -- and directors like Martin Scorsese (The Departed) and Steven Spielberg (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) took note.Winstone has just wrapped filming Darren Aronofsky's Noah opposite Russell Crowe, and this week he's in theaters as the lead in British hit The Sweeney -- an adaptation of the iconic 1970s police show on which, coincidentally, the star landed one of his earliest roles.

In 1994, the teenager was sentenced to death for his alleged part, along with two others, in the gruesome 1993 murder of three boys in Arkansas. Convicted by state prosecutors riding a wave of public and media hysteria, the so-called West Memphis Three spent the next 18 years in prison -- until an accumulation of new evidence raised doubts as to their guilt and, in 2011, they were finally set free. Having spent most of his adult life incarcerated, Echols has since become something of a celebrity, drawing the support of people like Peter Jackson, Johnny Depp and Eddie Vedder, who lent their weight to the campaign to free the falsely-accused men and expose the miscarriage of justice. Jackson also co-produced an extensive new documentary about the case -- Amy Berg's West of Memphis -- and with the film opening theatrically this week, we had the opportunity to sit down and talk with Echols recently.

One of Hollywood's hot young screenwriters in the '70s, Kasdan was enlisted by George Lucas to help pen The Empire Strikes Back, the film that -- along with the Kasdan co-written Return of the Jedi -- helped transform Star Wars from blockbuster movie into cultural myth. Soon after, Kasdan's second film as director, The Big Chill, effectively captured -- for better or worse -- the feelings (and musical tastes) of a generation of Baby Boomers entering thirtysomething adult life. And between those films, Kasdan's screenplay for Raiders of the Lost Ark was turned into another massive hit -- and enduring piece of movie iconography -- by Steven Spielberg. Kasdan returns after a lengthy hiatus with this week's Darling Companion, a comedy starring Kevin Kline and Diane Keaton about the search for a lost dog that brings on some typically Kasdan-esque moments of life assessment. We sat down for a chat with Kasdan earlier this week, in which he talked about his new film, his long collaboration with Kline, and his favorite memory writing on Empire. Read on for that, but first, he talks about his five favorite movies."

While independent cinema grew saturated with dysfunctional Sundance dramas and pop culture solipsism, Stillman's so-called ""yuppie trilogy"" -- Metropolitan (1990), 
Barcelona (1994) and The Last Days of Disco
 (1998) -- instead offered comedic portraits of hyper-literate, obsessive preppy types negotiating a world of social etiquette that felt extracted from another time. Fourteen years (and several aborted projects) after Disco, Stillman at last returns with 
Damsels in Distress, which opens in theaters in New York and Los Angeles this week. While on the press rounds for the film this week, Stillman took some time out to write about his five favorite films. ""These are just five of a possible 55 faves -- or more,"" he says.

Not too many actors can wear a khaki fishing vest and make it look good, but then not too many actors get away with impersonating Sir Alec Guinness, either.

Through no particular fault of her own, she was teetering on the brink of media overexposure -- the kind that comes from the usual perception of someone (and more often an actress) suddenly becoming too big, and too fast. Fox's well-publicized (and rather humorous) feud with her Transformers director Michael Bay lead to her being dismissed from the third installment (quick: try and remember the name of her replacement), while her would-be star vehicle -- the hopelessly misunderstood Jennifer's Body -- bombed with critics and audiences. Yet Fox's career is taking an arguably more interesting turn now that the white light of scrutiny has subsided: she's got roles in Judd Apatow's Knocked Up sequel This is 40 and Sacha Baron Cohen's The Dictator on the way, and this week stars as part of the ensemble cast of Jennifer Westfeldt's Friends with Kids. In the well-received comedy-drama, Fox plays Mary Jane, the much-younger girlfriend of single-dad-with-a-twist Adam Scott, while getting to act alongside a cast that includes Westfeldt, Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph.

The story goes that Soderbergh caught one of Carano's fights on TV one evening and couldn't believe the talented -- and visually striking -- fighter wasn't headlining her own movie. So, with the help of screenwriter Lem Dobbs (The Limey) and a supporting cast of thespian eye-candy that includes Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Antonio Banderas, Channing Tatum and Michael Douglas, he set about putting together an action vehicle for Carano, in which the fledgling actress plays a CIA-trained assassin on the loose and out to avenge those who double-crossed her. With its minimalist plot, punishing (yet expertly-staged) fight choreography and throwback thriller cool, Haywire is the kind of film that seems almost too good to be true in the movie release graveyard of January -- and, if fate smiles upon it, should make a new action hero of its leading lady. We had the chance to chat with Carano about the movie recently; but first, she ran through five of her all-time favorite films."

Perhaps more significantly, Corman was one of the pioneers of the independent movie model, cranking out scores of exploitation and genre films (and distributing foreign titles by Truffaut, Bergman, Fellini and Kurosawa) that turned profits even as they flaunted the traditional studio system. (Not to be discounted: he also directed a handful of genuinely fine movies, like the Edgar Allan Poe adaptation The Masque of the Red Death.)

This week, Pinto lends her talents to Immortals, visual stylist Tarsem Singh's visually stylish, violent and sometimes quite surreal imagining of ancient Greek mythology in which the actress portrays the oracle (and future lover of Henry Cavill's Theseus) Phaedra. We sat down with Pinto recently where she discussed her admiration for the director, the experience of working on her first big-budget film, and how it affects her performance.

Earlier this year, however, his latest film, Like Crazy, picked up the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, marking him as a young independent director to watch.  Starring Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones as a young couple trying to navigate the tricky waters of an international romance, Like Crazy has received some impressive reviews thus far, leading to a Certified Fresh stamp.

This week, Freeman lends his particular vocal stylings to the IMAX documentary  Born To Be Wild, a tale of two species of baby orphans -- orangutans and elephants -- fostered in the care of two rather remarkable ladies, Daphne Sheldrick and Birute Galdikas. Filmed in a 3-D that captures the creatures and their environments in vivid detail, the film, under its narrator's steady hand, makes an entertaining case for animal orphanages helping displaced babies back into the wild. We had the chance to sit down with Freeman recently, who graciously obliged our request to distill a lifetime's movie-watching into a list of his Five Favorite Films. ""It's gonna be difficult,"" he admits."

No, wait, is it the future? Yep, it's one of those cyclical narratives that revels in its sometimes confounding paradoxes. For Monaghan, who Jones cast having liked her in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, it meant playing the same scene, and character, on endless loop; adjusting her performance ever so slightly in reaction to the changing trajectory of Gyllenhaal's time-tripper.

But 22-year-old Rupert Grint has also been putting together a resume of smaller, character-driven films on the side, the latest of which, Wild Target, opens in US theaters this week. In this very British crime caper, Grint plays a kid who stumbles upon a deadly scenario and inadvertently becomes an apprentice hitman to Bill Nighy, all while getting to snuggle up to Emily Blunt and trade quips with the likes of Martin Freeman and Rupert Everett. RT was lucky enough to catch Rupert recently and pose that eternal question: ""Will there ever be a rainbow?"" We then asked him his Five Favorite Films."

""To me there are the usual suspects, in terms of the things I particularly like,"" he begins, when asked to break it down to five, ""from Apocalypse Now to Lawrence of Arabia to Bandwagon, to The Seventh Seal or Annie Hall or The Wizard of Oz or Cabaret.

From Gremlins and Stand By Me to The Goonies and The Lost Boys, the young actor notched up a succession of classics before those heady days of teen idolatry -- the so-called ?Two Coreys,? named for his movies with fellow pin-up Corey Haim -- would go on to enshrine him on the adolescent bedroom walls of an era. Though his well-publicized period since has been erratic -- and marred by tragedy, with Haim?s unfortunate death earlier this year -- Feldman has proved that he?s a survivor, returning to the role of vampire hunter Edgar Frog that he made famous in The Lost Boys. With this week?s latest installment, Lost Boys: The Thirst, reuniting him with fellow ?87 Frog brother Jamison Newlander, Feldman has come full circle -- complete with signature head band and copy of Batman No. 14.

Yet in this week's Nowhere Boy -- which explores the rocker's turbulent teenage life before he was famous-- British actor Aaron Johnson manages to move beyond mere impersonation, giving an affecting performance that captures the young Lennon's essence. That Johnson was just 18 at the time is impressive, as is the fact that he went directly from filming his lead in this year's superhero riff Kick-Ass to the very different role of a tortured teenager in 1950s Liverpool.

As Brad in My Son, My Son, Shannon convincingly embodies a deeply disturbed man whose life was changed during a rafting trip in Peru; upon his return to the States, he becomes consumed by religious fervor and his performance in a community theater -- and the result isn?t pretty.

His follow-up, The Business, recasts Danny Dyer and sets itself in the Costa Del Crime world of 80s Spain and had a similarly rocky reception with scribes. And yet he's one of Britain's better-known directors, suggesting he talks to an active audience of cinemagoers. With The Firm, Love revisits themes present in both films -- the 80s and football-fan violence -- but has more in common with his lesser-seen debut feature, coming-of-age comedy Goodbye Charlie Bright. Early notices have been warmer than Love tends to receive from critics, with Empire declaring the film, ""intense, exciting and impressive."" RT caught up with Love to rundown his favourite films and chat about the flick."
